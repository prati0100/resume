# Experience

## Texas Instruments
Software Engineering Intern  
January - June 2020

Device driver support on Linux and U-Boot for various TI platforms.

## Texas Instruments
Software Engineering Intern  
May - July 2019

Emulation of SMMUv3 Stage 1 Translations in Jailhouse.

- Jailhouse is an open source static partitioning hypervisor.
- Working on for ARM64 based TI SOCs.
- Expose a virtual SMMU to guest cells (VMs).
- Perform policing on the access to SMMU each guest cell so the cells are

## Google Summer of Code 2018
The FreeBSD Foundation  
April - August 2019

Imported Xen grant-table bus_dma(9) handlers from OpenBSD.

- Grant tables are a mechanism used to communicate between the Xen hypervisor
  VMs using shared pages.
- Wrote an implementation of the FreeBSD kernelâ€™s bus dma(9) interface
  integrating the grant table mechanism with the interface.
- Updated the Xen paravirtualized I/O drivers to use the new implementation,
  resulting in a more transparent integration with the rest of the OS.
